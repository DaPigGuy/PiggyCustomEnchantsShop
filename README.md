* We do not support any spoons. Anything to do with spoons (Issues or PRs) will be ignored.
* We are using the [libFormAPI](https://github.com/jojoe77777/FormAPI), so there is no need to install the FormAPI plugin.
    * In other words, you must use the pre-compiled phar from [Poggit-CI](https://poggit.pmmp.io/ci/DaPigGuy/PiggyCustomEnchantsShop/~) instead of GitHub.
